## File information

### Catalogs

- `./data`: Contains the dataset used in our method.
- `dataloade.py`:Processes miRNA-disease similarity and association data to generate embeddings and adjacency matrices, compiling them into a dataset named `common_set.pkl`. Then, splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and saves them as `train_set.pkl` and `test_set.pkl`, respectively.
- `parameters.py`:Defines hyperparameters for the FKRGAN model.
- `model0527.py`: Defines the FKRGAN model architecture.
- `feature_Block_train.py`:Optimizes the topological features and biological features (miRNA family characteristics and cluster features) for miRNA and disease nodes, as well as the miRNA family characteristics and miRNA cluster features.
- `relgan_train.py`:Trains the relation-aware adversarial network to generate enhanced feature representations.
- `train.py`:Trains the FKRGAN model.
- `tools4roc_pr.py`: Evaluates the performance of the FKRGAN model.
- `Supplementary Table ST1.xlsx`: Lists the top 50 candidate miRNAs for each disease.

## How to Run the Code

Before running the code, create two directories: `mdd` and `savedata`. The `mdd` directory stores `.pkl` files generated during the first step of Data Preprocessing, while the `savedata` directory stores model parameters.

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Process miRNA-disease similarity and association to generate embeddings, adjacency matrices, and compile them into a dataset file named `common_set.pkl`. Then, split the data into training, validation, and test sets, saved as `train_set.pkl` and `test_set.pkl`, respectively.

   ```
   python dataloade.py
   ```

2. **Feature optimization**: Optimize the topological features of miRNA and disease nodes, as well as the miRNA family characteristics and miRNA cluster features.

   ```
   python feature_Block_train.py
   ```

3. **Relation-aware adversarial network**: Optimize the feature representations of miRNA and disease nodes using a relation-aware adversarial network generator.

   ```
   python relgan_train.py
   ```

4. Train and test model.

   ```
   python train.py
   ```
